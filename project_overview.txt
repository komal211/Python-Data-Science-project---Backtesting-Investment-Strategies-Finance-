Backtesting Investment Strategies (Finance)
Goal: To create active strategies that outperform a passive buy and hold strategy for the Dow Jones index

-->Importing the data
-->Analyzing and visualizing data
    --process data and calculate daily returns based on daily prices
    --plot price over time using line plot
    --calculate return using percentage change method (pct_change())
    --plot price and return in one plot, need to create secondary y axis as scales are different for price and return
    --rename columns close as DJI_Close and return as DJI_Return
-->Backtesting a simple momentum strategy  
    --calculate annulaized risk and return for both strategies i.e. Buy and Hold, Simple momentum
-->Back test the strategies that are based on simple moving averages or short SMA
    --strategy also called crossovers
    --it can be argued that the most recent price trends that will persist also in the near future
    --whenever SMA 50 crosses above moving average with longer window for instance SMA 200, it is a signal to buy or to go along because of the most recent trend rising prices that will persist in the nnear future
    --whenever SMA 50 crosses below SMA 200, it is signal to sell or to go short because the most recent trend falling prices in the near future
    --comparing SMA crossover momentum strategy with buy and hold
    --determine daily returns of strategy and prices
    --calculate annualized risk and return
-->Backtesting the perfect strategy
    --assume perfectly predict the future
    --in morning of each trading day, predict whether dow jones index will rise or fall on that day and take appropriate position
